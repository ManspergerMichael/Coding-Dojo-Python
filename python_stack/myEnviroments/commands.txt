To activate virtual environment:
	source flaskEnv/bin/activate

Use homebrew to start your MySQL Server as a  "service", meaning it will run in the background and allow connections.
brew services start mysql
Brew services stop mysql
Now with MySQL installed, you have access to some new command line tools. Run the following command to set the MySQL root user's password to "root".
mysqladmin -u root password "root"
mysql -u root -p
